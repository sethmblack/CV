        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>👋 Hey, I'm Seth — a Site Reliability Engineer who likes solving the problems everyone else quietly assumes are impossible.</p>
        <p>I work at the intersection of <strong>incidents, observability, automation, and FinOps</strong>, turning noisy, manual operational pain into event-driven systems that quietly do the right thing in the background.</p>
        <p>Recent examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building a <strong>PagerDuty compliance automation</strong> that continuously audits teams, escalation policies, and schedules against on-call standards and keeps contact data clean so pages actually reach the right person.</li>
            <li><strong>Reverse-engineering New Relic billing</strong> to turn opaque, month-behind vendor invoices into near real-time usage and cost visibility for finance, with breakdowns by ingest type, account, and application.</li>
            <li>Designing a <strong>New Relic ↔ CMDB tagging pipeline</strong> that pulls entities from New Relic, aligns them with CMDB tags, and automatically updates tags in New Relic to eliminate drift and improve dashboard/alert accuracy.</li>
            <li>Implementing multiple <strong>serverless workflows on AWS (Lambda + EventBridge)</strong> to handle recurring SRE tasks — audits, reports, configuration checks, and data sync — reducing manual toil and standardizing operational hygiene.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also mentor interns every year, pairing them with real SRE/automation projects and coaching them on incident response, observability, and production-grade engineering.</p>
        <p>Off-call, I'm usually hanging out with my dogs, yelling at the TV during <strong>Chiefs games</strong>, and unapologetically being a <strong>Swiftie</strong>.</p>
